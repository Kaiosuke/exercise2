      <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
      <p>
        This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about cooking technique called
        <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food
        (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is apercisele
        set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his
        cook, <cite> Cooking fir Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes if as
        "ultra-low temperature poaching".

        <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a
        seat ar the chef table, contact us before
