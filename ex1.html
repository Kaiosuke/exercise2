      <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
      <p>
        This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about cooking technique called
        <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food
        (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is apercisele
        set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his
        cook, <i> Cooking fir Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes if as "ultra-low
        temperature poaching".

        <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a
